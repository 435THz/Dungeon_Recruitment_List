# Dungeon Recruitment List
By: MistressNebula

This [PMDO](https://github.com/audinowho/PMDODump/releases) mod allows
the player to access the full Recruitment List of explored dungeons,
accessible from the Others menu while in a Ground Map.
This list shows all Recruitable Pokémon up to the highest reached
floor of a dungeon, complete with the exact floor number you can find
those Pokémon at.
It even contains some explanation screens and an icon mode.

Using ths mod in dev mode will display unrecruitable Pokémon, as well.

**Warning**: longer dungeon lists can take some seconds to load.

### How the mod operates
This mod swaps the Recruitment Search option in the game's Others menu
with a Recruit one.
This new sub-menu is also accessible outside of dungeons and contains
4 more options:

1. **Dungeons/List**: The top option changes depending on your
location. It will be "List" when inside a dungeon, and "Dungeons"
outside.
    - **Dungeons**: When choosing this option, the game will load a
list of all Dungeons you have even just partially explored. Choose
one, and the game will show you all Pokémon that can be recruited
in the portion of the dungeon you have explored and where to find
them. Just be mindful: dungeon data is quite slow to work with, so
the bigger dungeons can take a couple of seconds to load.
    - **List**: Choose this option and the game will show you the
game's regular Recruitment Search screen.
2. **Info**: Shows what is essentially a recap of this README, but
in-game and in a more compact format.
3. **Colors**: Lists the various colors used in the mod to 
differentiate which pokémon have already been recruited and which ones
do or do not respawn upon defeat.
4. **Options**: Displays a toggle option for the mod's
*Scanner Mode* and *Icon Mode*. If *Scanner Mode* is on, then you
will be able to see the exact data used to spawn a specific Pokémon,
and if *Icon Mode* is on, the list will also use special icon markers 
to distinguish between caught, non-caught and pokémon spawned in special ways.
